# Attendance_Sheet

## Main Idea

    Digitalizing Attendance Sheet. 

## Overview 

    We have created a website that is created keeping in mind, issues our respected faculty are facing. 

Issues they face are: 
    
    1. Marking in paper one by one for every student.
    
    2. If they have multiple classes, they have to keep all the attendance sheet with themselves.

    3. If in case they forget to bring the attendance sheet, they mark absentees on a paper than they mark in original marksheet at their office. 

    4. At the end semester, they have to count and evaluate percentage of each student one by one.

## Solution

    Create an online platform where teacher will mark attendance online.

## Implementation

    1. Created a login page for teacher.

    2. After login, teacher will have a DashBoard which contains all the subjects respective teacher is teaching which is categorized into courses with its department.

    
    3. Teacher can click on any of the subject and he will be able to see all the attendance he/she has added or else, will show an empty attendance record for the new entry.

    
    4. On the attendance list he can view the marked attendance for the respective date. 
    
    5. He can also update that attendance for that respective date.
    
    6. Also he will have the option to add new attendance.
